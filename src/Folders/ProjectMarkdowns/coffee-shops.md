## Boston Coffee Shops

This personal project was designed in my free time to experiment more with Google's APIs.

### Goals:

- To design a webpage that allows users to enable their location and see nearby cafes.
- To allow for users to determine whether or not the cafe meets their needs.

### Initial Ideas:

I was inititally inspiried by my friends and I always trying to find the perfect coffee shop to study at. We have a hard time determining if a new coffee shop we are planning to visit has enough seating for our work, WiFi, etc.

I wanted to create something that would be able to be used at your current location, therefore I enabled current locations in order to determine the nearest cafes.
