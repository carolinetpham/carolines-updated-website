## AEye - High Fidelity Figma Prototype

IS4300 - Human Computer Interaction Final Group Project

### Process

This was a full UX Design process. My team and I did research, conducted usability testing, created sketches, wireframes, low fidelity prototypes, and finally a high fidelity prototype.

We wanted to create an app that is similar to that of Quizlet or Duolingo to help those learn to decipher between real life applications and AI applications. We wanted to make it fun, so we included a daily challenge, similar to how the New York Times' Wordle has a new challenge everyday, as well as some learning modules that will allow you to gain points and compete on the leaderboard with your friends or globally!

We created three different personas based on initial interviews, conducted additional interviews to figure out what people enjoy about a learning game like Duolingo or Quizlet, as well as usability testing.

When we went through usability testing, we actually realized that some of our design choices were not usable for all users. Some participants had issues finding the "Add Friends" button, hence we changed the location and added additional ways to find this button.

Additionally, we made sure to create storyboards and user journeys to see how our user's feel, how they may interact with our application, as well as ensuring that our app stayed consistent with our personas.
