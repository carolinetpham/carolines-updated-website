## EverFit Belt Design
This project was designed for my ARTF1250 - Designing Interactive Experiences class!

### Goals:
- To design a fictional object that doesn't exist in the world today using paper.
- To ensure the product was inclusive to everyone.

### Materials:
- Glue
- Construction paper
- Cardstock
- Scissors

### Initial Ideas/Research:
I was initially inspired by traditional leather belts. Although leather belts are great, they fail to adapt to fluctuating body sizes. I wanted to design a flexible object that could adapt to anyone's body seamlessly.

The goal of the product was to design a belt that could be purchased once and used for a lifetime, ultimately reducing fast fashion.

Belts were originally documented in the Bronze Age, and they were primarily used for holding weapons and tools for men. They were extremely popular in Greek and Roman militaries due to their small sort of protection. By the 19th century, belts become a fashion statement for men. Women didn't start using belts until after men, and they primarily used it to hold personal items, but once the purse came into play, belts became a fashion statement.

EEG technology captures movement, and they need to be placed strategically.

### The Big Idea
I wanted to incorporate EEG sensors as a way to sense the body fluctuating. As the body fluctuates, the belt is supposed to automatically adapt to the user's body to ensure it is tightened/loosened as needed. This way, people wouldn't have to think about always adjusting their belts.

### The Overall Process
I initially started by creating a paper prototype of a traditional leather belt to see how they buckled, and overall the structure and how it would look using paper.

After this, I started to create a persona and storyboard in order to figure out who my target audience was. The storyboard showcases that a daughter of a mom always needs a new belt due to her growing at a rapid pace. Her mom is having difficulties affording new belts all the time until she stumbles across my belt -- The EverFit Belt by SustainBelts. This belt allows users to choose their minimum size they think they need as well as the largest size they want. The belt is able to expand as much as the user wishes, however in order to save materials, the user inputs the largest size they believe they could possibly need.

My first prototype did not go very well. For starters, it wasn't actually usable, as I accidentally glued the belt as one loop, rather than having it be able to be inserted into belt holes.

My second prototype went better, as it actually was usable, but it honestly wasn't fashionable still, and I hadn't thought of how I wanted to incorporate the EEG sensors. The bright green color also isn't a common belt color you see.

My final prototype was ultimately the one I went with. It was usable and stylish, as it was black with a gold buckling. I also incorporated "EEG sensors" for the adaptability.

### Website
In the end, I decided to quickly throw together a Figma design of how the website may look for those who want to purchase this belt.
