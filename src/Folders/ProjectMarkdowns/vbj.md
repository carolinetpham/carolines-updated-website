## Virtual Bullet Journal
Final group project for CS 3500 - Object Oriented Design! 

### Process 
This was my final project for my Object Oriented Design (OOD) class! We had to create a bullet journal virtually. 

A bullet journal is essentially a planner that is customizable to the user. Most people tend to create different themes for each month! We created a UML diagram to structure our code, and used JavaFX for the GUI portion of our project. We had to use Model-View-Controller and SOLID principles for organization. Users are able to write and save tasks and events for the week and save these files for later.
