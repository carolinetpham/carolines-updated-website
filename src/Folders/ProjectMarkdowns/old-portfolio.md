## Old Personal Portfolio

My previous portfolio!

### The Process

My old personal portfolio was fully functional. This was my very first time using React, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I had actually attended a "Website Hack Day" hosted by Women in Technology, a club that I partake in. I have always loved the world of front-end and design, so learning React and JavaScript was super fun for me. The club taught us some basics of JavaScript, Figma, React, and Bootstrap.

I spent a majority of the club working on a Figma design that I thought would represent my personality well (although, looking back on it, I wish I had used less purple)! After the club, I spent a while implementing it to replicate my Figma design as best as I could!

### Why new portfolio?

Although my previous portfolio worked perfectly fine, I thought I could do better. I wanted to create something a bit more interactive as well as show off my design skills. Additionally, being in web development taught me a bunch of new skills that I wanted to practice outside of class, so I thought creating a new portfolio would be a perfect way to do that.
