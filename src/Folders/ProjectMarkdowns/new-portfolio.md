## Updated Personal Portfolio (Caroline's Desktop)

This website!

### Thoughts, Ideas, Structure

Overall, I wanted a creative way to showcase my personal portfolio. Caroline's Desktop, what I've called this portfolio is supposed to emulate a desktop simulation. I designed it so that users can have their own interactive experience while exploring and getting to know a little bit more about me!

I didn't want to provide a password for this page, as I want anyone to be able to view it. So the home page asking for a name is my version of a "password". Additionally, I wanted to include a small tutorial in case anyone needed help figuring out what's going on.

I recently completed CS 4550 - Web Development at Northeastern, and I wanted to apply some of my new skills from that class into this new portfolio, which is why I decided to completely revamp my portfolio from my last one. Although my last one worked well, this website showcases more of my creative side, as well as applies new skills such as TypeScript, and React-Router. Additionally, I am using the Ant Design framework for UI elements, overall giving me a cleaner website look.

I have so many fun ideas I want to implement to this website, so visit back to see new features!
